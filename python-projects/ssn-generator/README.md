#SSN GENERATOR WITH TKINTER

I just want to upload this, its gonna be tricky to use on a linux local machine or a remote server without a GUI interface as i used the TKinter module. So this can only work on windows for now. In the updated version, i'll include ways to run a virtual graphic interface and other deployment methods.

For the lucky windows user or anyone with a GUI
Just run
`python3 ssn-generator.py` inside the program folder
